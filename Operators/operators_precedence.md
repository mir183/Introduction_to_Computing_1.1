# Python Operator Precedence

Operator precedence in Python defines the order in which different operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. This README provides a comprehensive list of operator precedence in Python.

## 1. Parentheses

Use parentheses `( )` to explicitly specify the order of evaluation.

## 2. Exponentiation

The `**` operator raises a number to the power of another.

## 3. Positive, Negative, Bitwise NOT

Unary operators for positive `+x`, negative `-x`, and bitwise NOT `~x`.

## 4. Multiplication, Division, Modulus

Binary operators for multiplication `*`, division `/`, and modulus `%`.

## 5. Floor Division

The `//` operator performs floor division.

## 6. Addition, Subtraction

Binary operators for addition `+` and subtraction `-`.

## 7. Bitwise Left Shift, Bitwise Right Shift

Binary operators for bitwise left shift `<<` and bitwise right shift `>>`.

## 8. Bitwise AND

The `&` operator performs bitwise AND.

## 9. Bitwise XOR

The `^` operator performs bitwise XOR.

## 10. Bitwise OR

The `|` operator performs bitwise OR.

## 11. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators include `==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, is, is not, in, not in`.

## 12. Logical NOT

The `not` operator performs logical NOT.

## 13. Logical AND

The `and` operator performs logical AND.

## 14. Logical OR

The `or` operator performs logical OR.

## 15. Conditional Expression (Ternary Operator)

The ternary operator `a if condition else b` provides a concise way for conditional expressions.

## 16. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators include `=, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=`.

Operators with higher precedence are executed first. If in doubt, use parentheses to explicitly specify the order of evaluation.
